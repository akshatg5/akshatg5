ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm **Akshat Girdhar**, an Electronics and Communication Engineer passionate about software development. ðŸš€
ðŸ”Œ My journey began in electronics, where I honed my problem-solving skills and an innate curiosity for how things work. As I ventured into software development, I discovered a whole new universe of possibilities.

ðŸ’» As an intermediate Python developer, I have practical experience with essential libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. I've contributed to Flask and Django applications, gaining proficiency in backend development. On the frontend, I work at an intermediate level with ReactJS and utilize ExpressJS for backend operations in JavaScript. I'm familiar with databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB. Exploring machine learning with Scikit-learn enhances my data analysis skills, especially in the realm of financial data. This blend of Python, web development, and JavaScript shapes my journey as a versatile software developer.

ðŸ’¹ Beyond coding, I possess an intermediate-level knowledge of finance and economics. I'm eager to combine my financial acumen with my coding skills to create data-driven solutions that empower decision-makers and drive business success.

âš½ Outside the tech world, I'm a sports enthusiast. I see the parallels between sports strategy and problem-solving in software development, and I'm always up for a good game or discussion about the latest sports trends.

ðŸŒŸ My goal is to continually learn, grow, and collaborate on innovative projects that make a meaningful impact. Let's connect and explore how we can create something extraordinary together!
